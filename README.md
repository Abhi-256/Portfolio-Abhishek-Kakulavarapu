This repository serves as my portfolio of Power BI dashboards that I have created. 
Each dashboard demonstrates my skills and expertise in data visualization using Power BI.

The full descriptionof each dashboard will be added soon. (Sorry for the inconvenience. I'm still owrking on the documentation part)

**About Me**
I am a highly skilled and motivated data analyst with extensive experience in the industry. My expertise lies in generating insightful reports and providing data-driven insights to stakeholders that help organizations make informed decisions.

Currently, I am working as a Business Analyst at FMS Solutions, where I have identified the need for process automation and implemented automation techniques using RPA. Additionally, I have gathered critical information from multiple teams within the organization and from BAU meetings with the stakeholders to generate useful reports using Power BI. I have also served as the liaison between the stakeholders and management team of the organization, ensuring timely completion of the project.

Previously, I have worked as a Data Analyst at Cognitive View and Probe Group, where I have developed detailed spreadsheets to identify trends and create revenue, profitability, and expense forecasts. I have generated forecasting reports to analyze revenue variance, business pipeline, and industry trends. Moreover, I have been part of requirements meetings with clients to understand business expectations and improve customer experience with better training from the analysis of the data.

In my roles as a Data and Reporting Analyst at Probe Group, I have continuously assessed current reporting techniques and developed improvements to boost accuracy. I have analyzed data from Metabase and served as a subject matter expert on call center performance metrics analysis, design, and development. I have generated queries utilizing DAX to create performance metrics reports of employees from the KPI data. Additionally, I have produced quality reports of regular call center performance metrics and daily call loads formatted in compliance with data quality standards. I have also collaborated with business analysts to understand and define requirements.

Throughout my career, I have gained proficiency in various technologies, including Power BI, SQL Server, MS Excel, Azure SQL, Amazon Comprehend, Python (Google Colab), and Metabase. I am passionate about data analysis and strive to provide actionable insights to organizations to drive growth and success.

I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set and contribute to the success of organizations.
